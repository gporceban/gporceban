# Dr. Guilherme Porceban

Hello! I'm a medical professional specialized in spinal surgery, currently serving as a preceptor at UNIFESP. I completed my medical degree and residency in Orthopedics and Traumatology at the University of São Paulo (USP). 

I'm part of the clinical staff at the Hospital do Coração (HCor), Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, and Hospital Sírio Libanês.

My current research interest lies in the application of Generative AI for medical purposes. I have published several books and chapters related to spinal surgery, received awards in Congresses of Spinal Surgery, and have made presentations at international spine congresses.

Feel free to reach out to me for more information about my work or to discuss potential collaborations.
